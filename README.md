# presentations

The Jupyter notebooks in this folder can be used for live interactive presentations. For their full functionalites the following packages are needed:

1. Jupyter notebook (I recommend to use an Anaconda distribution)
2. [Jupyter Scala](https://github.com/jupyter-scala/jupyter-scala), a Scala kernel for Jupyter
3. [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE), Reveal.js - Jupyter/IPython Slideshow Extension. I recommend to create a separate anaconda environment and install the package there.
